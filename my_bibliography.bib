  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Complications in colorectal surgery include a wide range of clinical conditions, which increase mortality, morbidity, hospital stay and costs. In some cases, the placement of a self-expanding metal stent may represent a possible therapeutic strategy, avoiding further surgery. METHODS: In order to verify the feasibility and safety of the technique, we reviewed the medical literature, between January 1997 and 2015, selecting 32 studies. Inclusion criteria were based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations. RESULTS: The estimated rate of early success was 73.3\% (95\% CI 66.3-79.3), raising from 25 to 68\% in the time frame 1997-2007. The rate of early complications was 31.4\% (95\% CI 25.3-38.3\%), progressively decreasing from 75 to 43\% up to 2009. The rate of surgery for acute complication was 9.3\% (95\% CI 6.0-14.2\%), reduced on time course from 25 to 9\%. The rate of closure of dehiscence was 74.5\% (95\% CI 62.8-83.5\%), while the rate of long-lasting success was 57.3\% (95\% CI 50.3-64.0\%). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic stenting in the early postoperative management of anastomotic complications after colorectal surgery should be considered in patients with minimal risk for sepsis, as a safe and often effective alternative to surgery. However, in order to establish the safety and efficacy of this technique, prospective studies involving a larger cohort of patients are required.},

  abstract = {AIM: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) can decrease complications and reduces hospital stay. Less certain is whether elderly patients can fully adhere to and benefit from ERAS. We aimed to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of enhanced recovery after colorectal surgery in patients aged {$\geq~$}65~years old. METHOD: A systematic search of Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane was performed to identify (i) studies comparing elderly patients managed with ERAS vs traditional care, (ii) cohort studies of ERAS with results of elderly vs younger patients and (iii) any case series of ERAS in elderly patients. End-points of interest were length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, readmission and re-operation, and ERAS protocol adherence. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included. Two randomized controlled trials demonstrated shorter hospital stay in elderly patients with ERAS compared with elderly patients with non-ERAS (9 vs 13.2~days, P~{$<~$}0.001; 5.5 vs 7~days, P~{$<~$}0.0001). Fewer complications occurred with ERAS in both randomized controlled trials (27.4\% vs 58.6\%, P~{$<~$}0.0001; 5\% vs 21.1\%, P~=~0.045). The majority of observational studies did not show differences in outcome between elderly and younger patients in terms of hospital stay, morbidity or mortality. Inconsistent findings between cohort studies may reflect the disparities in ERAS protocol definitions or differences in study populations. CONCLUSION: ERAS can be safely applied to elderly patients to reduce complications and shorten length of hospital stay. Further studies are required to assess whether elderly patients are able to adhere to, and benefit from, ERAS protocols to the same extent as younger patients.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Maintaining perioperative normothermia has been shown to decrease the rate of surgical site infection (SSI) after segmental colectomy and is part of the World Health Organization's Guidelines for Safe Surgery. However, strong evidence supporting this association is lacking, and an exact definition of normothermia has not been described. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intraoperative hypothermia in patients who undergo segmental colectomy is associated with postoperative SSI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective cohort study at a single tertiary-referral hospital, 296 adult patients who underwent elective segmental colectomy from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, were included. Exclusion criteria included postoperative stoma, emergent or urgent operation, and diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. EXPOSURES: Perioperative temperature was measured continuously, and 4 possible definitions of hypothermia were explored, including temperature nadir, mean intraoperative temperature, percentage of time at the temperature nadir, and percentage of time with a temperature of less than 36.0\textdegree C. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 30-day SSI. Secondary outcome measures included clinical leak, return to the operating room, and nasogastric tube placement (a surrogate for ileus). RESULTS: The mean (SD) findings were as follows: intraoperative temperature, 35.9\textdegree C (0.6\textdegree C); temperature nadir, 34.3\textdegree C (2.8\textdegree C); percentage of time at the nadir, 4.7\% (10.8\%); and percentage of time with a temperature of less than 36.0\textdegree C, 49.9\% (42.0\%). The rate of SSI was 12.2\% (n\,=\,36). There was no statistically significant difference in temperature measurements between the patients who developed an SSI and those who did not. Logistic regression models evaluated each exposure measure and its effect on SSI, adjusting for body mass index, smoking status, and sex. The adjusted analyses revealed no association between intraoperative hypothermia and 30-day SSI (odds ratio, 1.17; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.81; P\,=\,.48). Increased body mass index (odds ratio, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.76; P\,=\,.007) was significantly associated with SSI in all 4 logistic regression models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients who underwent segmental colectomy and sustained a period of intraoperative hypothermia were no more likely to develop an SSI than those who were normothermic.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess with a single-blinded, multicenter, randomized trial, the postoperative results in patients undergoing sphincter-saving rectal resection for cancer without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP). BACKGROUND: The collective evidence from literature strongly suggests that MBP, before elective colonic surgery, is of no benefit in terms of postoperative morbidity. Very few data and no randomized study are available for rectal surgery and preliminary results conclude toward the safety of rectal resection without MBP. METHODS: From October 2007 to January 2009, patients scheduled for elective rectal cancer sphincter-saving resection were randomized to receive preoperative MBP (ie, retrograde enema and oral laxatives) or not. Primary endpoint was the overall 30-day morbidity rate. Secondary endpoints included mortality rate, anastomotic leakage rate, major morbidity rate (Dindo III or more), degree of discomfort for the patient, and hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 178 patients (103 men), including 89 in both groups (no-MBP and MBP groups), were included in the study. The overall and infectious morbidity rates were significantly higher in no-MBP versus MBP group, 44\% versus 27\%, P = 0.018, and 34\% versus 16\%, P = 0.005, respectively. Regarding both anastomotic leakage and major morbidity rates, there was no significant difference between no-MBP and MBP group: 19\% versus 10\% (P = 0.09) and 18\% versus 11\% (P = 0.69), respectively. Moderate or severe discomfort was reported by 40\% of prepared patients. Mortality rate (1.1\% vs 3.4\%) and mean hospital stay (16 vs 14 days) did not differ significantly between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This first randomized trial demonstrated that rectal cancer surgery without MBP was associated with higher risk of overall and infectious morbidity rates without any significant increase of anastomotic leakage rate. Thus, it suggests continuing to perform MBP before elective rectal resection for cancer.},
